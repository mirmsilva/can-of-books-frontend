- How often will you take breaks?
  - Whenever, we will communicate with each other
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

### Cooperative
- Make a list of each person’s strengths.
   - Miriam: Backend, Frontend
   - Jona: Bootstrap, Backend, Frontend
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  - If a person feels very comfortable then they will take the lead
- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Miriam would like to get more comfortable working on Frontend. Jona would like to improve on organization & code comments
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  - leave a lot of comments in our code, semantic naming no potato

### Conflict Resolution
- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - approach each other first, then Michelle if there's no improvement
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - approach each other first, then Michelle if there's no improvement
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - the person with a better understanding will take the lead and also explain the concept to the other
